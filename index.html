    You have reached the personal web page of the visionary computer game maker Karolis Dikcius, best known for games
    such as <a href="desertofvice.html">Desert of Vice</a> & <a href="ladderhead.html">Ladderhead</a>.. I am based in Vilnius, Lithuania and I have been doing whatever I have been doing since 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I am not making games I enjoy reading literature, watching films and taking my dog on a walk. In the past I have also enjoyed making analog electric
    guitar effect circuits.
  </p>
  <p>
    My most recent project is <a href="ladderhead.html">Ladderhead</a>, a text adventure about a man bound to a time and a place
    in the aether.
